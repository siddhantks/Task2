# UI Engineering Assignment

### Objective
Exact replication of the provided Figma design with a focus on responsiveness.

### Design Decisions
- **Responsiveness:** Used Tailwind CSS's utility-first breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`) to handle layout reflow.
- **Scaling:** Typography scales down on mobile to prevent overflow.
- **Extensions:** Added 'About' and 'Pricing' pages using the same color palette and spacing rules
