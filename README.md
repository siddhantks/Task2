# UI Engineering Assignment

### Objective
[cite_start]Exact replication of the provided Figma design with a focus on responsiveness[cite: 115, 116].

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. To view responsiveness, use Chrome DevTools (F12) and toggle device modes (Mobile/Tablet/Desktop).

### Design Decisions
- [cite_start]**Responsiveness:** Used Tailwind CSS's utility-first breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`) to handle layout reflow[cite: 136].
- [cite_start]**Scaling:** Typography scales down on mobile to prevent overflow[cite: 136].
- [cite_start]**Extensions:** Added 'About' and 'Pricing' pages using the same color palette and spacing rules[cite: 140].
